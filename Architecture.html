									<p>Using algorithms as the medium to explore and develop architectural design ideas, it is possible to achieve Generative Architecture. Using a pure programming-based representation of the intended design not only speeds up the handling of changes that always occur as the design evolves, but also allows for a much larger solution space derived from the formalized representation.</p>

										<h2>Facade Design</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Nowadays, architectural facades are characterized by complex shapes and patterns, mainly due to the use of new design tools, such as Generative Design, which promote a greater design exploration. Using these tools, we developed a computational framework for the generation and exploration of facade designs. The framework includes a classification of facades that helps the designer identify the set of algorithms that best suits the needs of his design intent. By combining the various algorithms provided by the framework, the designer can more easily explore the solution space of the intended design. The following examples were all generated using the framework. </p>

                            <br />The developed facade was based on concepts like permeability-opacity and complexity-randomness. It used bricks of two sizes and these could be protruded or not. The permeability was obtained through the absence of the smaller bricks. The decision between placing a bigger brick or four small bricks was randomly controlled, as also was the creation of protruded bricks and bricks absences.
